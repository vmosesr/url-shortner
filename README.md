I have developed a robust Laravel 12.x starter application designed for seamless multi-authentication, enabling secure access control for different user roles. This solution provides a scalable foundation with pre-configured authentication logic, middleware, and role-based access, ensuring flexibility for diverse applications. Built with clean, maintainable code and best practices, it accelerates development while maintaining high security standards. Whether for SaaS platforms, admin-user portals, or enterprise applications, this starter pack simplifies authentication while enhancing efficiency and user management.  

To get started, simply clone the repository, install dependencies, and configure the environment settings:  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   composer install  
   npm install && npm run dev  
   ```

3. **Configure the Environment**:  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  
   php artisan key:generate  
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**:  
   - Update `.env` with database credentials.  
   - Run migrations and seed default roles/users:  
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate --seed  
     ```

5. **Start the Server**:  
   ```bash
   php artisan serve  
   ```

This setup ensures a quick and efficient deployment, allowing developers to focus on building their application without worrying about authentication complexities. ðŸš€
